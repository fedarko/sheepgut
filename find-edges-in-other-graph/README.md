This directory contains some code used in the transition from working with
a smaller assembly graph to working with a larger assembly graph (constructed
using the original data plus ~5x as much data).

One of the first tasks in this transition was taking sequences of interest
from the smaller graph and trying to find them in the larger graph -- code
for this is included here.

(This code is kept around mostly for historical reasons.)
