-Created edges.fasta containing the seqs of all the edges in the (new) graph

-Aligned reads to edge sequences using minimap2, creating alignment.sam

-Converted alignment.sam to alignment.bam using samtools view. Ran overnight.
 NOTE: connection was lost at some point overnight due to broken pipe, but the
 file seems like it is about the expected size.
 NOTE 2: wait no now samtools sort is saying it's missing an EOF so probs
 corrupted :|

-Sorting and indexing alignment.bam (TODO)

-Computing pileups (TODO)
