    "- `seq2pos2totalcov.json`: Maps sequence name to a mapping from position (1-indexed) to the total number of aligned reads covering that position. Includes all reads in the alignment (with the exception of partially-mapped reads, which I filtered explicitly).\n",

    "- `seq2pos2matchct.json`: Maps sequence name to a mapping from position (1-indexed) to the number of aligned reads covering that position __that actually match the reference at this position__.\n",

    "\n",
    "- `seq2pos2mismatchct.json`: Maps sequence name to a mapping from position (1-indexed) to the number of aligned reads covering that position __that do not match the reference at this position__. This does not include deletions -- it should only include actual mismatches in the alignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- `seq2pos2mismatches.json`: Maps sequence name to a mapping from position (1-indexed) to another mapping, where the keys can be any of `A`, `C`, `G`, `T` and the values are the number of time this non-matching base was seen in the reads aligned to this sequence. Nucleotides not seen at a position are omitted from the innermost mapping, so if the `mismatchct` of this position is 0 then this will be `{}`.\n",
    "\n",
    "These JSON files, even considering the sum of their file sizes, are much smaller than a BAM file.\n",
    "(That being said, at this point they have become large enough to not really be workable with in-memory on an average laptop anyway...)\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE: positions are stored as strings due to this being roundtripped through JSON. TODO, if we store / load as ints this should fix pyplot stuff with plotting spectra and decrease filesize.**"
