Since it's easier to explain, I'll stick with 429 dimensions, but feel free to change `USE_ALL_POSITIONS` to `False` below (and if you want to try out even more stuff, to change `p` below to something different like `1.5%`) and see how things change.\n",

I think this does change things a bit (at least for the PCA) when using the more liberal deletion-inclusive definition of disagreement, since the features (positions) now have a lot more variation. In any case, think we'll stick with all dimensions for now."
