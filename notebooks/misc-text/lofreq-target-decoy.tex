LoFreq called 57, 16,131, and 84 mutations in the CAMP, BACT1, and BACT2 genomes, respectively. In terms of mutations per megabase for each genome, these are 44, 7,491, and 30 for CAMP, BACT1, and BACT2, respectively and after rounding. We can evaluate the FDR of LoFreq's calls in the same way as earlier: using the CAMP genome as a decoy, we estimate the FDR for BACT1 as $\frac{44.21}{7,490.97} \approx 0.0059$.\endinput
