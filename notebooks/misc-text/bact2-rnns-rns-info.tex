We consider the BACT2 genome at the threshold $p = 0.5\%$.
%
In this genome, there are $N'$ = 2,295,807 nucleotides
located throughout all sense codons (we ignore stop codons in the reference genome).
%
BACT2 has $J$ = 6,622,979 possible non-nonsense and
$K$ = 264,442 possible nonsense single-nucleotide mutations.
%
Using $p = 0.5\%$, BACT2 contains
$X$ = 791 non-nonsense and
$Y$ = 1 nonsense rare single-nucleotide mutations.
%
At $p = 0.5\%$, then, the ratio of observed to possible non-nonsense single-nucleotide mutations
($R_{NNS} = X / J = \frac{791}{6,622,979}
\approx 0.00012$)
is larger than the ratio of observed to possible nonsynonymous single-nucleotide mutations
($R_{NS} = Y / K = \frac{1}{264,442}
\approx 0.00000$)
for BACT2.
