To illustrate this, we again consider
the BACT1 genome at the threshold $p = 0.5\%$.
%
In this genome, there are $N'$ = 1,942,314 nucleotides
located throughout all sense codons (we ignore stop codons in the reference genome).
%
BACT1 has $J$ = 5,525,851 possible non-nonsense and
$K$ = 301,091 possible nonsense single-nucleotide mutations.
%
Using $p = 0.5\%$, BACT1 contains
$X$ = 12,185 non-nonsense and
$Y$ = 15 nonsense rare single-nucleotide mutations.
%
At $p = 0.5\%$, then, the ratio of observed to possible non-nonsense single-nucleotide mutations
($R_{NNS} = X / J = \frac{12,185}{5,525,851}
\approx 0.0022$)
is much larger than the ratio of observed to possible nonsynonymous single-nucleotide mutations
($R_{NS} = Y / K = \frac{15}{301,091}
\approx 0.000050$)
for BACT1.
