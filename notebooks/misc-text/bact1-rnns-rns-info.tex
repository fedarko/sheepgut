To illustrate this, we again consider
the BACT1 genome at the threshold $p = 0.5\%$.
%
In this genome, there are $N' = 1,942,314$ nucleotides
located throughout all sense codons (we ignore stop codons in the reference genome).
%
BACT1 has $J = 5,525,851$ possible non-nonsense and
$K = 301,091$ possible nonsense single-nucleotide mutations.
%
Using $p = 0.5\%$, BACT1 contains
$X = 17,849$ non-nonsense and
$Y = 23$ nonsense single-nucleotide mutations.
%
At $p = 0.5\%$, then, the rate of non-nonsense single-nucleotide mutations
($R_{NNS} = X / J = 17,849 / 5,525,851
\approx 0.0032$)
is much larger than the rate of nonsynonymous single-nucleotide mutations
($R_{NS} = Y / K = 23 / 301,091
\approx 0.000076$)
for BACT1.
