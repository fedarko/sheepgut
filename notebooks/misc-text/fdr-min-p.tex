The average coverages of the three selected MAGs are 4,159x, 1,415x, and 2,993x for the CAMP, BACT1, and BACT2 genomes, respectively. Since we mandate that the na\"ive calling method cannot call mutations at positions where alt(pos) $\leq 1$, we limit $p$ in this section's plots to the minimum possible value of $\frac{2}{\text{average coverage}}$ across the three selected MAGs.We thus set the lower limit of $p$ as $\frac{2}{1,415.07} \approx 0.1413\%$. Using $\big\lceil \frac{p \cdot 100}{100} \big\rceil$ to round this value to the nearest 0.01\%, we get a lower limit $p$ of 0.15\%.\endinput
