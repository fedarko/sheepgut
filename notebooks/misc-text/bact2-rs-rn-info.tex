For the BACT2 genome
(where $N$ = 2,303,508),
there are $J$ = 1,566,483 possible synonymous and
$K$ = 5,344,041 possible nonsynonymous single-nucleotide mutations.
%
Using the mutation frequency threshold $p = 0.5\%$,
the BACT2 genome contains
$X$ = 251 synonymous and
$Y$ = 541 nonsynonymous rare single-nucleotide mutations.
%
Thus, the ratio of observed to possible synonymous single-nucleotide mutations
($R_S = X / J = \frac{251}{1,566,483}
\approx 0.00016$)
is 1.6 times larger than the ratio of observed to possible nonsynonymous single-nucleotide mutations
($R_N = Y / K = \frac{541}{5,344,041}
\approx 0.00010$)
for BACT2.
