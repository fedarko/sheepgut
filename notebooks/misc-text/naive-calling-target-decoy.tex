At $p=0.5$\%, we identified 249, 17,069, and 1,632 rare $p$-mutations in the CAMP, BACT1, and BACT2 genomes, respectively. This illustrates that there exists a difference of nearly two orders of magnitude in the number of rare $p$-mutations per megabase across these genomes (193, 7,927, and 582 for CAMP, BACT1, and BACT2, respectively). If the CAMP genome, which has a relatively low mutation rate, is selected as a decoy, then we estimate the FDR for the BACT1 genome at $p=0.5\%$ as $\frac{193.14}{7,926.56} \approx 0.0244$.\endinput
