At $p=0.5$\%, we identified 283, 24,393, and 1,647 $p$-mutations in the CAMP, BACT1, and BACT2 genomes, respectively. This illustrates that there exists a difference of nearly two orders of magnitude in the number of $p$-mutations per megabase across these genomes (220, 11,328, and 587 for CAMP, BACT1, and BACT2, respectively). If the CAMP genome, which has a relatively low mutation rate, is selected as a decoy, then we estimate the FDR for the BACT1 genome at $p=0.5\%$ as $\frac{219.51}{11,327.70} \approx 0.0194$.\endinput
