For example, at $p=0.5$\%, we identified 283 $p$-mutations in the CAMP genome and 24,544 $p$-mutations in the BACTERIA genome, corresponding respectively to 219.51 and 11,397.82 $p$-mutations per megabase. If the CAMP genome, which has a relatively low mutation rate, is selected as a decoy, then we estimate the FDR for the BACTERIA genome as $\frac{219.51}{11,397.82} \approx 0.02$.\endinput
