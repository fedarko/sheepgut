At $p=0.5$\%, we identified 283, 24,544, and 1,655 $p$-mutations in the CAMP, BACT1, and BACT2 genomes, respectively. This illustrates that there exists a difference of nearly two orders of magnitude in the number of $p$-mutations per megabase across these genomes (220, 11,398, and 590 for CAMP, BACT1, and BACT2, respectively and after rounding). If the CAMP genome, which has a relatively low mutation rate, is selected as a decoy, then we estimate the FDR for the BACT1 genome at $p=0.5\%$ as $\frac{219.51}{11,397.82} \approx 0.0193$.\endinput
