At $p=0.5$\%, we identified 248, 17,097, and 1,632 rare $p$-mutations in the CAMP, BACT1, and BACT2 genomes, respectively. This illustrates that there exists a difference of nearly two orders of magnitude in the number of rare $p$-mutations per megabase across these genomes (192, 7,940, and 582 for CAMP, BACT1, and BACT2, respectively). If the CAMP genome, which has a relatively low mutation rate, is selected as a decoy, then we estimate the FDR for the BACT1 genome at $p=0.5\%$ as $\frac{192.36}{7,939.56} \approx 0.0242$.\endinput
