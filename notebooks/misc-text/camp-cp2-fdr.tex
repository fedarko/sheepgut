For example, at the frequency threshold $p=0.5$\%, there are only 54 $p$-mutations in CP2 in the CAMP genome, resulting in 137 mutations per megabase of the CP2 positions (as compared to 220 for the entire CAMP genome). Therefore, the estimate of the FDR for called mutations in the BACT1 genome can now be reduced from 0.0194 to 0.0121.\endinput
