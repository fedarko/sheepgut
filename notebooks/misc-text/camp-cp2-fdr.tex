For example, at the frequency threshold $p=0.5$\%, there are only 52 rare $p$-mutations in CP2 in the CAMP genome, resulting in 132 mutations per megabase of the CP2 positions (as compared to 193 for the entire CAMP genome). Therefore, the estimate of the FDR for called mutations in the BACT1 genome can now be reduced from 2.4\% to 1.7\%.\endinput
