Out of a total of 787 / 1,559 / 2,196 intergenic regions in the CAMP / BACTERIA / BACTEROIDALES genomes, respectively, 39 / 671 / 268 regions have nonzero mutation rates (using the threshold $minfreq=0.5\%$). (The rounded average intergenic region lengths for each genome are 128 / 133 / 234 bp, respectively.)\endinput
