Out of a total of 787 / 1,559 / 2,196 intergenic regions in the CAMP / BACTERIA / BACTEROIDALES genomes, respectively, 37 / 665 / 249 regions have nonzero $p$-mutation rates (using the threshold $p=0.5\%$). (The rounded average intergenic region lengths for each genome are 128 / 133 / 234 bp, respectively.)\endinput
