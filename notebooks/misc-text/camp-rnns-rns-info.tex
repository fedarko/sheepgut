We consider the CAMP genome at the threshold $p = 0.5\%$.
%
In this genome, there are $N'$ = 1,188,561 nucleotides
located throughout all sense codons (we ignore stop codons in the reference genome).
%
CAMP has $J$ = 3,395,872 possible non-nonsense and
$K$ = 169,811 possible nonsense single-nucleotide mutations.
%
Using $p = 0.5\%$, CAMP contains
$X$ = 96 non-nonsense and
$Y$ = 9 nonsense rare single-nucleotide mutations.
%
At $p = 0.5\%$, then, the ratio of observed to possible non-nonsense single-nucleotide mutations
($R_{NNS} = X / J = \frac{96}{3,395,872}
\approx 0.00003$)
is unexpectedly smaller than the ratio of observed to possible nonsynonymous single-nucleotide mutations
($R_{NS} = Y / K = \frac{9}{169,811}
\approx 0.00005$)
for CAMP.
