Out of a total of 1,297 / 1,761 / 2,568 genes in the CAMP / BACTERIA / BACTEROIDALES genomes, respectively, 126 / 1,530 / 765 genes have nonzero mutation rates (using the threshold $minfreq=0.5\%$). Of these genes, 116 / 1,404 / 647 genes have nonzero nonsynonymous mutation rates. (The average gene lengths for each genome are 919.46 / 1,105.98 / 896.74 bp, respectively.)\endinput
