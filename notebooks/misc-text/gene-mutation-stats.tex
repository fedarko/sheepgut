Out of a total of 1,297 / 1,761 / 2,568 genes in the CAMP / BACTERIA / BACTEROIDALES genomes, respectively, 110 / 1,526 / 682 genes have nonzero $p$-mutation rates (using the threshold $p=0.5\%$). Of these genes, 101 / 1,397 / 581 genes have nonzero nonsynonymous mutation rates. (The rounded average gene lengths for each genome are 919 / 1,106 / 897 bp, respectively.)\endinput
