Out of a total of 1,297 / 1,761 / 2,567 genes in the CAMP / BACT1 / BACT2 genomes, respectively, 110 / 1,522 / 677 genes have nonzero $p$-mutation rates (using the threshold $p=0.5\%$, and only considering ``reasonable'' $p$-mutations where the reference nucleotide is also the most frequent, or one of the most frequent, aligned nucleotides). Of these genes, 101 / 1,331 / 572 genes have nonzero nonsynonymous mutation rates. (The rounded average gene lengths for each genome are 919 / 1,106 / 897 bp, respectively.)\endinput
