For the CAMP genome
(where $N$ = 1,192,452),
there are $J$ = 741,223 possible synonymous and
$K$ = 2,836,133 possible nonsynonymous single-nucleotide mutations.
%
Using the mutation frequency threshold $p = 0.5\%$,
the CAMP genome contains
$X$ = 40 synonymous and
$Y$ = 67 nonsynonymous rare single-nucleotide mutations.
%
Thus, the ratio of observed to possible synonymous single-nucleotide mutations
($R_S = X / J = \frac{40}{741,223}
\approx 0.00005$)
is larger than the ratio of observed to possible nonsynonymous single-nucleotide mutations
($R_N = Y / K = \frac{67}{2,836,133}
\approx 0.00002$)
for CAMP.
