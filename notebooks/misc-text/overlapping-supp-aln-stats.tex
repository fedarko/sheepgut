Before filtering overlapping supplementary alignments and before filtering
partially-mapped reads, the following supplementary alignment statistics held.
In the CAMP genome, 8,221 / 499,437 (1.65\%) unique reads aligned to within the genome had supplementary alignments within the genome.
 Furthermore, 1,957 / 499,437 (0.39\%) of unique reads with supplementary alignments had overlap between at least one pair of their alignments on the reference genome.

In the BACTERIA genome, 5,632 / 267,166 (2.11\%) unique reads aligned to within the genome had supplementary alignments within the genome.
 Furthermore, 395 / 267,166 (0.15\%) of unique reads with supplementary alignments had overlap between at least one pair of their alignments on the reference genome.

In the BACTEROIDALES genome, 4,561 / 744,077 (0.61\%) unique reads aligned to within the genome had supplementary alignments within the genome.
 Furthermore, 435 / 744,077 (0.06\%) of unique reads with supplementary alignments had overlap between at least one pair of their alignments on the reference genome.
