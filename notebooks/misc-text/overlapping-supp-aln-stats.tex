Before filtering overlapping supplementary alignments and before filtering
partially-mapped reads, the following supplementary alignment statistics held.

In the CAMP genome, 8,221 / 499,437 (1.65\%) unique reads aligned to within the genome had supplementary alignments within the genome.
Furthermore, 1,957 / 499,437 (0.39\%) unique reads with supplementary alignments had overlap between at least one pair of their alignments on the reference genome.
The average overlap length (considering all pairs of overlapping alignments from the same read) was 315.88 bp.

In the BACTERIA genome, 5,632 / 267,166 (2.11\%) unique reads aligned to within the genome had supplementary alignments within the genome.
Furthermore, 395 / 267,166 (0.15\%) unique reads with supplementary alignments had overlap between at least one pair of their alignments on the reference genome.
The average overlap length (considering all pairs of overlapping alignments from the same read) was 1,313.50 bp.

In the BACTEROIDALES genome, 4,561 / 744,077 (0.61\%) unique reads aligned to within the genome had supplementary alignments within the genome.
Furthermore, 435 / 744,077 (0.06\%) unique reads with supplementary alignments had overlap between at least one pair of their alignments on the reference genome.
The average overlap length (considering all pairs of overlapping alignments from the same read) was 3,030.65 bp.
